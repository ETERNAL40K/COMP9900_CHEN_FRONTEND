Week1 
This week we formed a team. For the ReadRecommend project that we are about to carry out, 
I put forward the technical route and the staffing plan with reference to my experience.
Also, I configured the front-end development environment by myself on this Sunday.In next week,
if possible,we decided to finish our proposal.
